1. Tell me about Python?
    Python is a high-level program
    Python is interpreted
    Python is dynamically-typed
    Python supports multiple programming paradigms
    Python Object-oriented 
    Python is scripting language
========================================================================================================================    
2. Why Python is so popular now a days?
    * Python is easy to learn and use - python is easy for both beginners and newcomers to learn and understand as it syntax is easy and simple to understand 
    * Python uses a amazing libraries that can work in bigger projects.some of libraries are numpy,scipy for scientific computing to django for web development
    * Python has Big data that has use of cloud computing solutions 
    * python is versatile as we can use in Ml,AI,data science,game & web development 
    * Python used by big companies ,it is going to become even more popular and trusted
========================================================================================================================    
3. Features of Python

    d.portable-windows,linux
    e.object oriented 
    f.extensible-we can write in other programming languages
    g.dynamically typed 
    h.high-level
=========================================================================================================================    
4. Advantages and Disadvantages of Python
    Advantages - a.easy to code
                 b.easy to read
                 c.free and open-source
                 d.portable-windows,linux
                 e.object oriented 
                 f.extensible-we can write in other programming languages
                 g.dynamically typed 
                 h.high-level
                 
    Disadavantages - a.low speed and time consuming
                     b.weak in mobile devices
                     c.difficult to access database
                     d.it causes runtime errors
                     e.runtime errors
======================================================================================================================
5. Why Python is Dynamically Typed Language?
    We don't have to declare the type of variable while assigning a value to a variable in Python.
    Other languages like C, C++, Java, etc.., there is a strict declaration of variables before assigning values to them.
    It states the kind of variable in the runtime of the program. So, Python is a dynamically typed language
======================================================================================================================
6. Why Python is Interpreted?
    Python is an Interpreted programming language because it executes every Python-based instructions line by line.
    It can understand Python syntaxes and tokens written in a high-level language and can make
      it understandable to the computer.
=======================================================================================================================
7. Memory Management in Python?
    Memory management in Python involves a private heap containing all Python objects and data structures. 
    The management of this private heap is ensured internally by the Python memory manager.
=======================================================================================================================
8. Garbage Collection in Python?
    Python deletes unwanted objects automatically to free the memory space.the process by which periodically
      frees and reclaims the blocks of memory that no longer are in use is called garbage collection
=======================================================================================================================      
9. Python is Platform independent.Explain
    Python program that can run on virtually all operating systems and platforms without having to be re-written again.
    Python uses PVM to convert python code to machine understandable code.
=======================================================================================================================
10. How compilation will happen internally. Explain in detail 
    compilation happens, but it’s just not into a machine language. It is into byte code (.pyc or .pyo) and this byte code can’t be understood by the CPU. So we need an interpreter called the python virtual machine to execute the byte codes.
    Step 1 : The python compiler reads a python source code or instruction. Then it verifies that the instruction is well-formatted, i.e. it checks the syntax of each line. If it encounters an error, it immediately halts the translation and shows an error message.
    Step 2 : If there is no error, i.e. if the python instruction or source code is well-formatted then the compiler translates it into its equivalent form in an intermediate language called “Byte code”.
    Step 3 : Byte code is then sent to the Python Virtual Machine(PVM) which is the python interpreter. PVM converts the python byte code into machine-executable code. If an error occurs during this interpretation then the conversion is halted with an error message. 
=======================================================================================================================
11. Interpreted vs Compiled time programming languages. Explain in detail?
    Interpreted  - python is an interpreted language,which means the source code is converted to byte code that is then executed by Python Virtual Machine
    compile time - Compile time is the period when the programming code is converted to machine code.
=======================================================================================================================
12. .py vs .pyc files ?
    .py is python source code files. 
    .pyc contains the byte code of the python files.
