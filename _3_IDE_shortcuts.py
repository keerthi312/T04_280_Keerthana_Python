1. Different IDE's in Market?

    Integrated development environments (IDE) are applications that facilitates the development of other applications.
    Designed to encompass all programming tasks in one application, one of the main benefits of an IDE is that they offer a central interface with all the tools a developer needs, including:

    Code editor             : Designed for writing and editing source code, these editors are distinguished from text editors because they work to either simplify or enhance the process of writing and editing of code for developers.
    Compiler                : Compilers transform source code that is written in a human readable/writable language in a form that computers can execute.
    Debugger                : Debuggers are used during testing and can help developers debug their application programs.
    Build automation tools  : These can help automate developer tasks that are more common to save time.

    Multi-Language IDE
    The multi-language IDEs â€“ like Eclipse, Aptana, Komodo, NetBeans, and Geany

    IDE for Mobile Development Processes
    Specifically for mobile development, there are IDEs that include PhoneGap and Titanium Mobile from Appcelerator.

    HTML IDE
    IDEs for developing HTML applications are some of the most popular IDEs around. For example, DreamWeaver, HomeSite, and FrontPage

    IDE Made for Certain Languages
    There are specific IDEs that cater to programmers who work in one language. These include Jikes and Jcreator for Java, CodeLite and C-Free for C/C++, RubyMine for Ruby/Rails, and Idle for Python.

2. Advantages of IDE
Faster setup            : Programmers need to spend time configuring multiple development tools without an IDE interface in place.
Faster development tasks: the tools and features of the IDE help programmers organize resources, prevent mistakes, and implement shortcuts.

3. Shortcuts in PyCharm (Explain min 10)
Shortcut           - Action
Double Shift       -Search Everywhere

Quickly find any file, action, class, symbol, tool window, or setting in PyCharm, in your project, and in the current Git repository.

Ctrl+Shift+A       -Find Action

Find a command and execute it, open a tool window, or search for a setting.

Alt+Enter          -Show Context Actions

Quick-fixes for highlighted errors and warnings, intention actions for improving and optimizing your code.

F2                 -Navigate between code issues

Shift+F2           -Jump to the next or previous highlighted error.

Ctrl+E             -View recent files

Select a recently opened file from the list.

Ctrl+W             -Extend or shrink selection

Ctrl+Shift+W       -Increase or decrease the scope of selection according to specific code constructs.

Ctrl+/             -Add/remove line or block comment

4. Different ways to write python program.
Interactive     : Interactive mode allows you to rapidly analyze and visualize data using concise and efficient single-line commands. In interactive mode, commands typed at the IDL prompt are executed when the Enter key is pressed.

IDLE            : IDLE is Python's Integrated Development and Learning Environment. It allows programmers to easily write Python code. Just like Python Shell, IDLE can be used to execute a single statement and create, modify, and execute Python scripts.

Command Prompt  : It is the Windows command line and you can perform many system functions. It is handy to know where to find the Command Prompt for system administration

IDE             : IDE stands for Integrated Development Environment. It's a coding tool which allows you to write, test, and debug your code in an easier way, as they typically offer code completion or code insight by highlighting, resource management, debugging tools
